# 📘 Day 01 — Programming Introduction  
**Week 01: Fundamentals**

⏱ Time: 2–3 Hours  
🎯 Focus: Understand what programming really is (logic > language)

## ❓ What is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to solve problems.

A program is:
- A set of logical steps
- Written in a language computers understand
- Executed line by line

💡 Key idea:  
Programming is NOT about memorizing syntax.  
Programming is about thinking logically.

## 🧠 How Does a Program Work?

Basic flow:

Input → Processing → Output

Example:
- Input: Numbers from user
- Processing: Add numbers
- Output: Show result

Every software, app, or website follows this logic.

## 🧩 Compiler vs Interpreter

### 🔹 Compiler
- Translates entire code at once
- Creates an executable file
- Faster execution

Examples:
- C
- C++

---

### 🔹 Interpreter
- Executes code line by line
- No separate executable file
- Easier for beginners

Examples:
- Python
- JavaScript

## 🌐 Why Learn Multiple Languages?

You are not learning languages randomly.

Each language teaches you something important:

| Language | What it Teaches |
|---------|----------------|
| C | Core logic & memory |
| Java | Object-oriented thinking |
| Python | Clean logic & productivity |
| HTML | Structure |
| CSS | Design |
| JavaScript | Interaction & behavior |

🎯 Logic is same. Syntax changes.

## 🛠 Practice (MANDATORY)

Create a Hello World program in at least one language.

### Example (Python)
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
### Example (C)
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
### Example (Java)
```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
Choose ONE language today.
Do not try all if you feel overwhelmed.
