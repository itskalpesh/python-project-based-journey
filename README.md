## ❓ Why Learn Programming the Right Way?

Most people fail at programming not because it’s hard, but because they:
- Jump between languages randomly
- Memorize syntax instead of logic
- Build no real projects

This repository is designed to help you **learn programming the right way** —  
**logic first, projects always, step by step.**
